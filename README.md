# Express-Sequelize-API boilerplate
This is a simple boilerplate for creating APIs with NodeJs express framework.
Here API access token encapsulated/encrypted with JWT token based system.
 - Sample API ready for login 
 - API middlewares for normal user and Admin user
 - ES6 import/export available to the user with spread operators
 - Deploy your app with cluster (cluster implementation is integrated)
 - jest test configured
 - add test case for mock database model/functions to test controllers functions
## Getting Started
You can download this repo or clone using below command. (folder-name will be project folder in which you want to start your project).
```
git clone https://github.com/binitghetiya/express-sequelize-api-boilerplate.git <folder-name>
```
or from **Download Zip**
```
https://github.com/binitghetiya/express-sequelize-api-boilerplate 
```
### Project Setup
Once you clone or download project go into you folder

>now cope **.env.local** file to **.env** file

### Installing
```
> npm install or yarn install  (this will install all dependent libraries)
```

### Database Config Setup
Create new database (let's say i'm going to use mysql and my database name is **express-sequelize-api**).
so in my **.env** file will set below parameters.
```
DB_HOST=localhost               # database connection host
DB_USER=root                    # database username
DB_PASS=secret@123              # database password
DB_NAME=express-sequelize-api   # database name
```
some other inportant parameters/keys in **.env** file
```
APP_HOST=localhost      # application host name
APP_PORT=3000           # application port
SECRET=secret           # secret key for encrypt/decrypt JWT token
```

are you going to user google captcha while register? then also add/update in .env 
```
IS_GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLE=true          # enable google captcha
GOOGLE_CAPTCHA_SECRET_CLIENT=secret
GOOGLE_CAPTCHA_SECRET_SERVER=secret
GOOGLE_CAPTCHA_URL=https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify
```


### Migration and Seeders run
After creating database and updating .env file run below commands
```
> sequelize db:migrate
> sequelize db:seed:all
```
Migration will create table users and seed some default users
* **users** - this is normal user table with some required fields like (firstName, lastName, email, password, and isAdmin)
Seeders will create one new client entry in application and 2 users entry one admin and one normal user.

`npm start` to run your project 
>Everythig is setup and you are good to go now. Happy Coding :)



# Other Information about setup
## Git/Bitbucket Setup
```
> rm -rf .git  (Remove git folder so you can use your own git/bitbucket)
```
## Middlewares
```
> ApiAuth this will check user access token that we have return in login response.
> AdminAuth this will check admin auth and it's access.
```

## Routing files
> Currently we have added 3 routing files 
```
> pub.js   # public routing access everyone can access this APIs
> api.js   # only logged in user/ with vaild token user can access this routes
> admin.js # only admin can access with valid token
```
## Example APIs
>here attached link of postman collection you can download and check in local
